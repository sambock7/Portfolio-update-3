          <p>Hi, my name is Sam.  I am 29 years old and live in Ridgewood, Queens.  I work in digital marketing, currently, but aspire to be a full-stack developer so I am attending a coding bootcamp at Columbia University for 6 months.  I am not sure which area of development I want to pursue yet, but I'm hoping I will figure it out as I go along.  I know I am interested in making my ideas come to life and development will make that happen.</p>
    
          <p>A little about my background, I grew up in New Rochelle, NY and I was passionate about playing softball and basketball. I later went to college at Arizona State University and majored in Marketing and minored in Film and Media Productions. </p>
    
          <p>My first major career move was working for the Arizona Diamondbacks as their social media manager, responsible for all content on their Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.  I moved on to Elio Motors where I was a marketing director and then worked for several startups and tech companies afterwards.</p>
